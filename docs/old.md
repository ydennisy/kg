[Awesome CLI Apps](https://github.com/agarrharr/awesome-cli-apps#note-taking-and-lists) -
the idea being here is that to make an MVP it should be a CLI app.

CLI Apps:

- https://taskell.app/
- https://taskwarrior.org/
- https://github.com/IonicaBizau/idea
- https://github.com/simeg/eureka
- https://github.com/darrikonn/td-cli
- https://github.com/klaussinani/taskbook
- https://github.com/dnote/dnote

Features

- search
- save to own repo
- setup to save to specific location (file, git, dropbox...)
- train ML to answer questions from own KG
- annotate
- make comments, notes public to show trending topics (like HN)

Seems easier as is much more defined.

The interface could be more a case of saving articles.

Later being able to question/search your own KG.

Could KG be like git with some append only data structure. So you keep adding to
your knowledge
