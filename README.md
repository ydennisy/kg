# `kg`: Knowledge Graph

`kg` is a knowledge management application, designed to help:

- archive and save information such as links
- use spaced repetition to remember knowledge
- create tiny bits of information `atoms` to later join into `molecules`
- selectively publish `nodes` to the web as a digital garden
